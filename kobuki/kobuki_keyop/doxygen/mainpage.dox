\section Overview

Provides a keyboard teleoperation control to kobukibot. Just enables a simple
increase velocity mechanism both linearly and angularly as well as power off 
and power on functions.

\section published Published Topics

- <tt>kobuki_keyop/cmd_vel (geometry_msgs/Twist)</tt>

Sends command velocities to the mobile base interface. 

- <tt>kobuki_keyop/enable (std_msgs/String)</tt>
- <tt>kobuki_keyop/disable (std_msgs/String)</tt>

Send power-off and power-on commands to the robot core.

\section Usage

Use a launcher to fire up the keyop command as this will allow you to map the above
topics to the appropriate namespace. e.g. there is a launcher in 
kobuki_keyop/resources/launch/robot_core.launch for ycs' robot core:

@code
<launch>
    <node pkg="kobuki_keyop" type="keyop" name="kobuki_keyop">
        <remap from="kobuki_keyop/enable" to="/robot_core/enable"/>
        <remap from="kobuki_keyop/disable" to="/robot_core/disable"/>
        <remap from="kobuki_keyop/vel_cmd" to="/robot_core/cmd_vel"/>
    </node>
</launch>
@endcode

You may wish to change the remappings to suit the currently running robot. You can initiate with

@code
roslaunch kobuki_keyop robot_core.launch
@endcode

and use the arrow keys to navigation, with 'e', 'd' to enable
or disable the motors and 'q' to quit.
